### Replication vs Reproducible Research

A basic tenet in science is the ability to replicate the results of any experiment<sup>(1,2)</sup>. Replication verifies results; however, research papers often lack the detail required for independent replication. Many attempts at replicating the results of well-known scientific studies have failed in a variety of disciplines <sup>(1)</sup>. 

Replicating studies with new data is expensive, for this reason computationally reproducible research is recommended as a way to assess the validity and rigor of scientific results<sup>(1,2)</sup>. Research is considered reproducible when others can reproduce results of a study with only the original data, code, conditions and documentation<sup>(1)</sup>. 

Reproducible research has most of the advantages of replicating studies without the financial and time burden associated with collecting new data<sup>(2)</sup>. It is the by-product of care and attention to detail throughout the research process and seen as a minimum standard that all researchers should strive for<sup>(1)</sup>.

#### Benefits of reproducible research<sup>(1)</sup>
- Easier to recall and explain work to collaborators, supervisors and reviewers
- Faster to modify analyses and figures
- Facilitates quick reconfiguration of research tasks for new projects with similar tasks
- It can increase the quality and speed of peer review
- Can increase citations and expanded research impact through the ability to access and cite the project code and data
- Enhances opportunities for research methods training
- Reproducible research is a strong indicator of rigour, trustworthiness and transparency

- A key person from your research team has disappeared (family, personal emergency or no longer contactable).
 - Could you continue your work? 
 - Do you know where your data is stored? 
 - Could you keep working effectively for 1 month? 1 year?

-{% include icon.html icon='laptop' %}You lose your laptop bag containing your all your external hard drives. 
 - Could you continue your work? 
 - Is your data backed up? Encrypted?

Someone has published contradicting results to your published paper
- Can your provide your data and methods?
 
A research partner organization believes your sensitive data has been breached or made available to a third party. 
- Can you show the steps taken and measures put in place to avoid this?
