1. Use [strong passwords](https://www.griffith.edu.au/passwords)
2. [Encrypt](https://www.griffith.edu.au/about-griffith/cybersecurity/data-protection) your computer's hard drive
3. Avoid unsecure wifi. If it is available, [Eduroam](https://www.griffith.edu.au/internet-access/wifi/eduroam) is a better option than free public or cafe hotspots/networks/wifi.

##### How to create strong passwords
 * Make your password unique for each of your important accounts
 * Make your password longer - at least 12 characters long. 14 or more characters is stronger
 * Create a phrase password, a line from a song, or something else you can remember, incorporating a combination of numbers, letters, lowercase letters and symbols, e.g. `HavEY0urse1FAMerrY##`  or `S1nt1sC0mingT0T0wn!`
 * Do not incorporate personal information into your password. For example, the name of a child, pet, important birthdays, details from your address
 * Find out if your email address has been compromised [here](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

##### Encrypt your hard drive
* Hard drive encryption converts a physical drive into an unreadable format that cannot be unlocked without the secret key or password that was used to encrypt it. Encryption prevents unauthorized people or hackers from accessing the information on the hard drive.

1. Is your lab/office encrypted?  Note: The boss's computer is usually the most insecure {% include icon.html icon='emoji-smile' %}. Organise for the whole team's computers to be encrypted.
2. Use a [VPN (Virtual private network)](https://au.pcmag.com/vpn/138/the-best-vpn-services) whenever youâ€™re not at work
3. Keep your operating system and products up to date (especially your web browsers)
* You can use [Qualsys Browser Check](https://browsercheck.qualys.com/) to confirm your browser is set securely
* Review Griffith's [cybersecurity-at-home](https://www.griffith.edu.au/about-griffith/cybersecurity/cybersecurity-at-home) for more information.{% endcapture %}{% include card.html header="Advanced" text=text %}
